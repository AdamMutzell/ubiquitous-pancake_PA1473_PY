## Project Description

This system is being developed for the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of a pick and place system, the effectiveness will be a result of changing the pickers from humans to robots. The robots are equipped with multiple sensors to enable them to navigate the environment, recognize items and other robots. The environment of which the robots operate in has been marked with lines to indicate where the robots are able to travel without the possibility of injuring a human. The current system for pick and place utilizes pallets to store goods, these goods are identified using the color of the plastic wrap utilized to secure the goods to the pallet, this system will not be modified to accommodate the implementation of robots due to budget restrictions. From this we expect that we will achieve a increased throughput of the warehouse. Below you will find a list of user stories gathered from observing the current workforce.
